# ABCD fMRI

A key component of the ABCD Study involves several fMRI tasks administered to youth participants at baseline and every 2 years thereafter. 

Those tasks include:

* Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) Task (Knutson et al., [2000](https://doi.org/10.1006/nimg.2000.0593))
* Stop Signal Task (SST) (Logan [1984](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1994-97487-005))
* Emotional N-Back Task (nBack) (Cohen et al., 2016b)
