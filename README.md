# ABCD Study Notes


## Overview 
The [ABCD Study](https://abcdstudy.org/) (Casey et al., [2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2018.03.001), Garavan et al., [2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2018.04.004)) is an unprecedented effort having recruited over 11,000 9-10 year-olds from 21 sites across the US. Further, the study adopts an open-science model, making data readily available to researchers. As with any endeavor of this scope, coordinated data access and harmonization is extremely difficult. 

The purpose of this guide is to assemble various pieces of information critical to well-organized, reproducible analyses using ABCD Study data. The target audience is researchers at the [UVM NERVE Lab](https://blog.uvm.edu/nerve/), although others miay find it helpful. 

Citations are included throughout. While we attempt to corral various guides and bits of software into a single repository, that isn't always practical or even helpful, as ABCD Study data is still in collection.

__This guide is meant to provide a top-level *practical* guide to working with ABCD Data. In particular, the goal is to provide researchers with the necessary *tools*, not to reinvent the wheel.__
